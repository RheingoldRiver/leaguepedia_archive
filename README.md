# Important
Don't expect ANY of this code to run as-is! This is a collection of archived code files I used to keep in a folder called `old_and_temp_scratch` in my Leaguepedia Utils repository, but don't want to do that anymore.

Link to main repo: https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/leaguepedia_util

This repo is just here because people have told me they found looking at my code useful, so I prefer to keep it all online somewhere. Code here is probably, on average, less complicated than code in active use, because I wouldn't have cared as much as setting things up properly, so it won't have a ton of dependencies etc.
